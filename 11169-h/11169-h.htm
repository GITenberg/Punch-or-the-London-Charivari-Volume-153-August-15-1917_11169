<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>"In the heroic days of 1914," says Count REVENTLOW, "God gave us
our daily bread and our daily victory." We feel sure that, as
regards the provision of victories, some recognition ought to be
made of the able assistance of the WOLFF Bureau.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We read with some surprise that, in the motor collision in which
he participated recently, Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL'S car <i>was run
into</i> by another coming in the opposite direction. This is not
the Antwerp spirit that the Munitions Department is waiting
for.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A movement is on foot for the presentation of a suitable
testimonial to the people of Dundee for returning Mr. CHURCHILL to
Parliament, after being distinctly requested not to do so by a
certain morning paper.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"What shall we do with the Allotment Harvest?" asks <i>The
Evening News</i>. It seems only too probable that, unless a
national effort is made to preserve them, some of the world's
noblest vegetables will have to be eaten.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Just as a soldier gives his valour or a captain of industry his
talent," said Lord CURZON, speaking on the sale of titles, "so a
wealthy man gives his wealth, which is very often his only asset,
for the benefit of his country." Nothing like a delicate compliment
or two to encourage him in the good work.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A lively correspondence has been filling the columns of a
contemporary under the heading, "The Facts about Bacon." The
discussion seems to have turned upon the famous line, "There's
something rotten from the state of Denmark."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sixpenny paper notes are now being issued in various parts of
Germany. If you can't find anything to buy with them you can use
them to patch the new paper trousers.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Judging by his recent speech, Herr VON BETHMANN-HOLLWEG has lost
heart and found a liver.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>At a recent inquest it was stated that a doctor had prepared a
death certificate while deceased was still alive. The subsequent
correct behaviour of the patient is regarded as a distinct feather
in the medical profession's cap.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A nephew of Field-Marshal VON HINDENBUBG has just joined the
United States Navy, but the rumour that upon hearing this
HINDENBURG tried to look severe is of course an impossible
story.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The sum of sixty pounds has been taken from the Ransom Lane Post
Office, Hull, and burglars are reminded that withdrawals of money
from the Post Office cannot in future be allowed unless application
is first made on the prescribed form.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Baron SONNINO, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, was
accorded a truly British welcome on his arrival in this country. It
rained all day.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It appears from a weekly paper that the KAISER is fond of nice
quiet amusement. If this is so we cannot understand his refusal to
have a Reichstag run on lines similar to the British
Parliament.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sir EDWARD CARSON'S physical recreations, says <i>The Daily
Mail</i>, are officially stated to be riding, golf and cycling.
Unofficially, we believe, he has occasionally done some
drilling.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>At a recent pacifist meeting in Bristol Councillor THOMPSON
declared that he was with Mr. LLOYD GEORGE in the South African
War, but was against him in the present campaign. The authorities
are doing their best to keep the news from the PREMIER.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A man at Tottenham has been fined five pounds for feeding a
horse with bread. We understand that action was taken on the
initiative of the R.S.P.C.A.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The German Government is doing everything possible to curry
favour with its people. It has now commandeered all stocks of
soap.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Bermondsey house of amusement has organised a competition, in
which the competitors have to eat a pudding with their hands tied.
This of course is a great improvement on the modern and more
difficult game of trying to eat a lump of sugar in a restaurant
with full use of the hands, and even legs.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An official notice in the British Museum Library states that
readers will incur little risk during air raids, "except from a
bomb that bursts in the room." It is the ability to think out
things like this which raises the official mind so high above the
ordinary.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The German Government, says the <i>Gazette de Lausanne</i>, is
establishing a regular business base in Berne. We have no illusions
as to the base business that will be conducted from it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"When a German travels round the world," said Dr. MICHAELIS in a
lecture delivered twenty-five years ago, "he cannot help being
terribly envious of England." Funnily enough he is as envious as
ever, even though the opportunities for travel are no longer
available.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>When the Folkestone raid syren goes off, a man told the Dover
Council, it blows your hat off. On the other hand if it doesn't go
off you may not have anywhere to wear a hat, so what are you to
do?</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Willesden allotment-holders are complaining of a shortage of
male blooms on their vegetable-marrow plants. This is the first

<h2>THRILLS FROM THE TERMINI.</h2>
<p>Mr. Punch, following the example of his daily contemporaries,
despatched a representative to some of the great London termini to
note the August exodus from town. The following thrilling report is
to hand:&mdash;</p>
<p>At Waterton and Paddingloo great crowds continued to board the
limited number of West-bound and South-west-bound trains. On being
asked why they were leaving town, those of the travellers who
answered at all said it was the regular time for their annual
holiday and they wanted a change. They were mostly a jolly hearty
lot, happily confident that at some time in the course of the next
forty-eight hours they would be deposited in some part of the West
or South-west of England. Those fortunate persons who had secured
seats were sitting down, those who were unable to get seats were
standing, and, in spite of the congested state of the carriages and
corridors, almost all were smiling, the exceptions being those
highly-strung and excitable passengers who had come to blows over
corner seats and windows up or down. Many of the travellers carried
baskets of food. Your representative, anxious to report on the
quality and quantity of the provisions carried, ventured to peep
into one of the baskets, and was in consequence involved in a
rather unpleasant affair, being actually accused of having
abstracted a sandwich!</p>
<p>The engine-driver, questioned as to whether he liked having
passengers on the engine and whether he considered it safe for
them, was understood to say that so long as they didn't get in his
way it didn't matter to him, and as to its being safe for them, he
jolly well didn't care whether it was safe for them or not. The
guard, detained by the sleeve by your representative, who inquired
how he felt about being almost crowded out of his brake by
passengers, drew away his sleeve with some violence and his answer
was quite unworthy to be reported. An elderly but strongly-built
porter, with the luggage of fourteen families on his truck, and the
fourteen families surrounding him and all talking at once, was
approached by your representative for a little quiet chat, but he
became so threatening that it was thought advisable to leave him
alone.</p>
<p>At Ticvoria Station your representative found a seething mob
intent on getting to those ever popular and already much
overcrowded South-coast resorts, Paradeville, Shingleton-on-Sea,
Promenade Bay, etc. The eleven-o'clock "Paradeville fast," due to
start in half-an-hour, was at No. 20 platform. All sitting and
standing room had been occupied for some hours, and the passengers
were enjoying the sport of seeing the later arrivals running the
whole length of the train and back again in the mad hope of finding
places. Your representative managed to get a word with some of
these later arrivals, and asked them how they liked running up and
down, and whether they were much disappointed at not finding room;
but the answers were mostly unsatisfactory and in some cases
uncivil. The booking-clerk, questioned as to the phraseology
employed by August holiday folk in asking for their tickets,
whether it is "Third return, please," or "Third return," or "Third
return and look sharp," showed by his answer that the expression
"please" is falling into desuetude on these occasions, his exact
words being "There's precious little 'please' knocking about, and
anyone who has the cheek to tell me to 'look sharp' is jolly well
kept waiting till the last!" Your representative, wishing to report
at first-hand the experience of those who were travelling thirty in
a compartment meant to accommodate ten in the "Paradeville fast,"
tried to get in and make a thirty-first, explaining that it was
only for a minute and was with the object of getting local colour,
but was forcibly expelled, and, falling on the platform and
sustaining some slight contusions, decided to cease reporting on
August scenes at the great termini for that day.</p>

<h3>THE NEW LOAF.</h3>
MR. LLOYD GEORGE. "LUCKY RHONDDA! BUT I TAUGHT HIM THOSE
NUMBERS."
</div>
<hr />
<h2>TWO DUMB WARRIORS.</h2>
<h4>I.&mdash;HYLDEBRAND.</h4>
<p>When the Heatherdale Hussars received a two-hours' notice to
"trek" they, of course, dumped their mascot, Hyldebrand, a
six-months-old wild boar, at the Town Major's. They would have done
the same with a baby or a full-grown hippopotamus. The harassed
T.M. discovered Hyldebrand in the next stable to his slightly
hysterical horse the morning after the H.H. had evacuated, and
informed me (his village Sanitary Inspector) that "as I was fond of
animals" (he had seen me distributing fly-traps and painting
horse-trough notice-boards) I was henceforth in sole command of
Hyldebrand until such time as his owners should reclaim him. A
grant of five sous <i>per diem</i> had been left for the piglette's
maintenance.</p>
<p>I took charge of Hyldebrand, provided an old dog-kennel for his
shelter, an older dog-collar for his adornment and six yards of
"flex" for his restraint. I further appointed the runner&mdash;a
youth from Huddersfield, nicknamed "Isinglass," in playful
sarcastic comment on his speed&mdash;second in command. He was to
feed, groom and exercise Hyldebrand. I would inspect Hyldebrand
twice a week.</p>
<p>Hyldebrand rose fast in village popularity. One forgot that his
parents had been shot for cattle maiming, body snatching, breaking
into granaries and defying the gendarmerie on the public roads. But
Hyldy was all docility. He ate his way through the grant, the
office stationery, and the central tin dump with the most disarming
<i>na&iuml;v&eacute;t&eacute;</i>. He was the spoilt darling of
every mess. The reflected glory which Isinglass and myself enjoyed
was positively embarrassing.</p>
<p>But as the summer advanced so did Hyldebrand. He became (to
quote his keeper) a "battle pig," with the head of a pantomime
dragon, fore-quarters of a bison, the hind-legs of a deer and a
back like an heraldic scrubbing-brush. In March I had inspected him
as he sat upon my knee. In June I shook hands with him as he
strained at his tether. In mid-September we nodded to each other
from opposite sides of a barbed wire fence. Yet Isinglass retained
the most complete mastery of his ferocious-looking
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and beneath his skilful massage Hyldebrand
would throw himself upon the ground and guggle in a porcine
ecstacy.</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, when there had come upon the little village
street the inevitable hush which preceded Hyldebrand's hour for
exercise, I espied the village cripple making for his home with the
celerity of an A 1 man. He glared reproachfully at me, and, with an
exclamation of "<i>Sacr&eacute; sanglier!</i>" vanished in the open
doorway of the local boulangerie, that being nearer than his
cottage. Then came Hyldebrand, froth on his snout and murder in his
little eyes, and after him Isinglass more than living up to his
equine namesake. I joined him, and, following Hyldy in a cloud of
dust, the runner informed me between gasps that it was "along of
burning his snout-raking for a bully-beef tin in the
insinuator."</p>
<p>A band outside B Mess was nearing the climax of GRIEG'S "Peer
Gynt" suite. Hyldebrand just failed to perpetrate the time-worn gag
of jumping through the big drum, but he contrived to make that
final crashing chord sound like the last sneeze of a giant dying of
hay-fever. The rest the crowd saw through a film of dust.
Hyldebrand headed for the turning by the school, reached it as the
gates opened to release young France, and comedy would have turned
to tragedy but for the point duty M.P. and his revolver.</p>
<p>There was a note and a parcel for <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page111" name="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> me a day or so after.
The note, which was addressed to and had been opened by the T.M.,
stated that Hyldebrand was being sent for by the Heatherdale
Hussars on the morrow. Outside the parcel was scrawled, above the
initials of the G.H.Q. officers' cook, a friend of mine, "It's top
hole&mdash;try it with a drop of sauce." Inside was a cold pork
chop!</p>
<h4>II.&mdash;ERMYNTRUDE.</h4>
<p>It so happened in a quiet part of the line that men were scarce
and work abundant, so it was decided to use mules to carry the
rations further than usual. All went well until one night when
friend Fritz changed his habits and put some assorted fireworks
rather near the mules.</p>
<p>Now the transport, being human and moreover unaccustomed to
fireworks, disliked this entertainment. Therefore they sought what
shelter they could. In a few minutes the Hun repented, but no mules
and no rations could the transport see. Moreover it began to rain.
So back they went and spoke at great length of the hundreds of
seventeen-inch which had blown up all the mules.</p>
<p>The morning began to come and a machine-gun subaltern, looking
at a black East in search of daylight, so that he might say, "It is
now light; I may go to bed," was somewhat startled. "For," he said,
"I have received shocks as the result of too much whisky of old,
but from a split tea and chloride of lime&mdash;no! It must be the
pork and beans." However, he collected eight puzzled but peaceful
mules and handed them to a still more bewildered adjutant, who knew
not if they were "trench stores" or "articles to be returned to
salvage."</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the Transport Officer was making inquiries, and
he recovered the eight mules. "All," he said, "are back, except
Ermyntrude. I grieve for Ermyntrude, but still more for my driver's
fate."</p>
<p>Where Ermyntrude spent the day no one knows. All that is known
is of her conduct the next night. About eleven o'clock she stepped
on a shelter, and, being a heavy mule, came into the trench
abruptly. This worried but did not hurt her, and she proceeded down
the trench at a steady trot, bumping into the traverses. She met a
ration party, and for the first time in their lives they took
refuge over the top, for Ermyntrude was angry.</p>
<p>Ermyntrude reached the end of the trench and somehow got out,
heading, by chance, for Germany. That was her undoing. In a minute
or so three machine-guns began firing, bombs and rifle shots were
heard, and Verey lights innumerable flared. We never saw Ermyntrude
again. But we heard of her&mdash;or rather we read of her&mdash;for
the German official report wrote her epitaph, thus: "Near the
village of &mdash;&mdash; hostile raiding detachments were repulsed
by our machine-gun fire."</p>

<h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>
<h5>LXIV.</h5>
<blockquote>MY DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Since I last wrote to you I have
enjoyed seeing again an officer with whom I had many curious
dealings in the past, and who, if half the facts he divulges about
himself were true, would certainly be the wickedest Colonel in the
B.E.F., notwithstanding that he fought busily in the early stages
and had the best part of himself knocked out in so doing. He has
performed many strange duties since, and the steps he took to
qualify for one of them will, I think, illustrate for you his
wickedness. It has been found, on experience, that modesty is out
of place when you are being called upon to state your
qualifications for a post. The knowing, upon being asked if they
possess certain attributes, reply in an immediate affirmative and
add others, just to be on the safe side. It is felt that what is
really required in this War is thrust and ingenuity, things which
adequately make up for the absence of any specialist knowledge.
Accordingly my friend found himself described as possessing, among
other things, "French, fluent." It was not until he was informed
that the Official Interpreter would like to hear a little of this
that he looked more closely into the matter and discovered that he
knew no French at all. Undismayed, he spent the two days' interval
before the <i>viv&acirc;-voce</i> examination in learning some. You
might suppose that two days is a short time in which to become so
familiar with a strange language that you may be able to understand
and answer any question which may be put to you in it. Sly friend,
however, did not let this worry him. He learnt by heart a long and
detailed narrative, embracing all the most impressive idioms and
all the most popular slang, the subject of which was an accident
which had occurred to him in the earlier days of the campaign, a
long and a vivid story, which, once started, would last
indefinitely and could not be interrupted meanwhile. Armed with no
other knowledge of the French language than this, my friend duly
presented himself before the Official Interpreter, greeted him with
a genial salute and waited throughout his opening speech, which was
in French and contained many inquiries. My friend made no endeavour
to follow these simple questions. He knew he couldn't succeed and
had no intention of giving himself away by an attempt. Advancing
towards the Interpreter's table and putting his right hand to his
ear, "Pardon, monsieur," he said, "mais je suis un peu sourd,
depuis mon accident." "Quel accident?" said the Interpreter; after
which my friend did not stop talking until he was passed out with a
"French, garrulous." We met quite recently and talked over things
in general, telling each other, in confidence and on the best
authority, all those exciting details of the progress of the War
which men go on saying and believing until they are officially
contradicted. Getting down to realities, he told me that he has now
the greatest difficulty in believing in the War at all, though he
is within ear-shot of it all the time. His difficulty is due to the
last thing he saw before he left his office: three men standing at
his gate, in that attitude of contented and contemplative leisure
which one associates with Saturday afternoons and village pumps,
looking at nothing in particular and spitting thoughtfully as
occasion required. One of them was a British soldier, one a French
soldier and one a German soldier. The whole picture suggested
anything but war; if there was a war on, which nation was fighting
against which? My friend, however, is somewhat oddly situated in
this respect, since he commands for the moment a detachment of
German prisoners in our back area. Some of them, he tells me, are
extraordinarily smart. One Prussian N.C.O. in particular was
remarkable. Dressed in his impressive overcoat, hatted for all the
world like our Staff and carrying under his arm his dapper cane,
this N.C.O. went round from group to group of working prisoners,
accompanying the English sergeant in charge of the party and
interpreting the latter's orders to the men. So striking was his
get-up that all paused to look at him. Thinking it might please
you, my friend showed me an official memo., which he had just
received from one of his officers in command of an outlying
detachment, and of course of the odds and ends of British personnel
adhering thereto: cooks, guards, etc. The memo. ran as follows, and
it repays careful study and thinking out; I give you the whole of
it:&mdash;
<blockquote><i>"To the Commanding Officer, Orderly Room,
Hqrs."</i><br />
<br />
The undermentioned is in my opinion entirely unfitted for the duty
to which he has been detailed with this detachment. He shows no
signs of either intelligence or industry, and I propose, with your
approval, to take the necessary steps to get rid of him
forthwith.<br />
<br />
A. B. SMITH,<br />
<br />
<i>Capt. i.c. 'B' Detachment.</i></blockquote>
My friend was much concerned to hit upon exactly the right form of
reply. Eventually we agreed:&mdash;
<blockquote><i>"To Capt. A. B. Smith, i.c. 'B'
Detachment.</i><br />
<br />
Good-bye.<br />
<br />
C. D. JONES,<br />
<br />
<i>Lt.-Col., O.C., etc., etc.</i>"</blockquote>
Finally, let me tell you a disgraceful tale of my same friend,
which does not refer to his present command, and is, I hope, untrue
of him in any command. The crowd for which he was then responsible
was suddenly threatened with inspection by the General who is
charged with the welfare of such people, and who very properly
desired to satisfy himself that they were both well disciplined and
well tended. So that success might be assured my friend had a
rehearsal parade. All inspections and manoeuvres being completed,
my friend stood the crowd at ease and thus addressed them:&mdash;
<blockquote>"All ranks will take the utmost care to turn themselves
out smartly for the inspection and to make the inspection a
success. As the General passes along the lines inspecting you, you
will stand rigidly to attention, eyes front. You will be asked if
you have any complaints to make, and each of you will have an
opportunity of making a complaint in the correct manner.<br />
<br />

paces forward, salute smartly, stand to attention and make his
complaint.<br />

<h3>A TRACT FOR GROUSERS.</h3>
<p>Ernest and I were seated by the river. It was very pleasant
there, and it seemed a small thing to us that we were both still
disabled.</p>
<p>"Did you ever say to yourself, when you were out there, that if
ever you got out of it alive you'd never grumble at anything
again?'" said Ernest.</p>
<p>My reply was in the affirmative.</p>
<p>We were silent for a while, remorse weighing heavily upon
us.</p>
<p>"The worst case," said Ernest at length, "was when I got my
commission and came home for my kit."</p>
<p>I composed myself to listen, piously determined not to grumble
however tedious I might find his recital.</p>
<p>"We'd been near a place called Ypres," he began.</p>
<p>"I seem to have heard the name," I murmured.</p>
<p>"I hadn't been sleeping really well for a week&mdash;we'd been
in the trenches that time&mdash;and before that I had lain somewhat
uneasily upon a concrete floor."</p>
<p>"Yes, concrete is hard, isn't it?" I said.</p>
<p>"We came out at three in the morning, and arrived at our billets
about seven. I knew this commission was on the
<i>tapis</i>&mdash;French word meaning carpet&mdash;so I hung round
not daring to turn in. At eleven o'clock I had orders to push off
home to get my kit. You'll guess I didn't want asking twice. I made
my way to the railhead at once in case of any hitch, and had to
wait some time for a train. It was a goods train when it came, but
it did quite well and deposited me outside the port of embarkation
about nine o'clock at night. I walked on into the port and found
the ship that was crossing next morning. I went below in search of
a cabin. There was a French sailor there to whom I explained my
need."</p>
<p>"How?" I asked, for I do not share Ernest's opinion of his
mastery of the French language, but he ignored this.</p>
<p>"It was dark down there," he went on, "too dark for him to see
that I was in a private's uniform, so I put on a bit of side and he
took me for an officer."</p>
<p>"A French officer?"</p>
<p>"Very likely. Anyway he found me a beautiful cabin with a lovely
couch in it all covered with plush. You would have thought I should
want nothing but to be left to sleep; but no, I saw that the
officer in the next cabin had a candle, and there was no candle for
me. Instantly my worst instincts were aroused. I felt I was being
put upon. I demanded a candle. The sailor declared there wasn't one
left."</p>
<p>"You're sure he understood what you were asking for?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know that candle is boogy, thank you. I argued with him
for ten minutes and then turned in, grumbling. Queer, wasn't
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>I sat there for a while, thinking over Ernest's story, which
had, it seemed to me, something of the tract about it.</p>
<p>Later the midges began to attack us.</p>
<p>"Aren't these midges absolutely&mdash;" I began, and then
stopped, remembering Ernest's tract. It only shows, as I said to
Ernest, that we may learn something even from the most unlikely
people.</p>

<h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>
<p><i>(The GERMAN CROWN PRINCE and Fritz, his Valet.)</i></p>
<p><i>The Crown Prince (in bed and yawning).</i> Is that you,
Fritz?</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Yes, your Royal Highness. What uniform shall I lay
out for his Royal Highness?</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> You can lay out the best I have&mdash;the one of
the Death's Head Hussars, with all my stars and medals. I am
expecting an important visit.</p>
<p><i>Fritz (with a meaning smile).</i> If I might venture so far,
I would suggest to his Royal Highness that he should wear the
Trench uniform, which I arranged with the bullet-holes and the
mud-splashes. It creates a greater effect, especially if the
visitor be a lady.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> Fritz, you dog, how dare you? Very well, have it
your own way and let it be the Trench uniform.</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> I am only anxious to promote his Royal Highness's
interest in every possible way.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> I know, I know. Only we shall have old
HINDENBURG growling and grunting and looking as black as a
thundercloud. I cannot imagine what my revered father sees in that
old wooden effigy, whose only idea of strategy is to retreat from
strong positions. That, at any rate, is not the fashion in which I
have learnt war. I'm thoroughly tired of hearing of all these
HINDENBURG plans, which come to nothing.</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Your Royal Highness is, of course, right. But what
I say to myself is that the ALL-HIGHEST, your Royal Highness's most
gracious father, has in all this a deep-laid design to show
conclusively that all these HINDENBURG plans mean nothing, so that
in the end true skill and merit may have a chance, and the chief
command may be placed in the only hands that are fit to exercise
it. Oh, yes, I know what I'm talking about, and everyone I meet
says the same.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> I have always felt that that must be so. No
matter, a time will come. By the way, Fritz, have you packed up the
<i>S&egrave;vres</i> dinner-service?</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> I have already packed six from as many different
French and Belgian houses, and have sent them to Berlin, according
to your Royal Highness's directions. Which does your Royal Highness
refer to?</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> I mean the one with the simple pattern of pink
flowers and the coat-of-arms.</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Yes, that I have packed like the rest and have
sent off.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> And the silver dishes and the lace?</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Yes, they have all gone.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> Good. And the clocks?</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Yes, I did in every case what your Royal Highness
ordered me to do.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> And you packed them, I hope, with the greatest
care?</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> I did; nothing, I am certain, will suffer
damage.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> Excellent. War is, no doubt, a rough and brutal
affair, but at least it cannot be said that we Prussians do not
behave like gentlemen.</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Your Royal Highness speaks, as always, the plain
truth. How different from the degenerate French and the intolerable
English.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> Yes, Fritz; and now you can go. Stay; there was
something I wanted to ask you. Dear me, I am losing my memory. Ah!
I have it. How is my offensive getting on? Has any news come in
from the <i>Chemin des Dames</i>?</p>
<p><i>Fritz.</i> Your Royal Highness's offensive has not advanced
to any great extent. The French last night recaptured all their
positions and even penetrated into ours.</p>
<p><i>The C.P.</i> Did they? How very annoying. Somebody bungled,
of course. Well, well, I shall have to put it right when I have
time. Have you finished laying out my uniform? Yes. Then you can
go.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<h5>"THE BETTER 'OLE."</h5>
<p>I must congratulate Mr. CHARLES COCHRAN on his courage in
transforming the Oxford Music-hall into a home of "the legitimate,"
and still more on his good fortune in securing for the initiation
of his new venture the play which Captain BRUCE BAIRNSFATHER and
Captain ARTHUR ELIOT have written round the adventures of "Old
Bill." In form it resembles a <i>revue</i>, but I prefer to call it
a play, because it possesses a plot, distinct if slight&mdash;an
encumbrance banned by most <i>revue</i> producers; and because it
contains an abundance of honest spontaneous fun. The authors start
with the advantage, if it be an advantage, that the principal
characters are already familiar to the audience through the medium
of Captain BAIRNSFATHER's popular drawings; but they have not been
content with reproducing their well-known, now almost hackneyed,
adventures, but have added many others which are new and yet "come
into the picture."</p>
<p>Their greatest piece of luck was in finding a comedian exactly
fitted to fill the part of the humble hero. Mr. ARTHUR BOURCHIER as
<i>Old Bill</i> is absolutely "it." His make-up is perfect; he
might have stepped out of the drawing, or sat for it, whichever you
please. But, much more than that, he seems to have exactly realised
the sort of man <i>Old Bill</i> probably is in real
life&mdash;slow-speaking and stolid in manner, yet with a vein of
common-sense underlying his apparent stupidity; much addicted to
beer and other liquids, but not brutalized thereby; and, while
often grousing and grumbling, nevertheless possessed almost
unconsciously of a strong sense of duty and an undaunted
determination to see it through. It is a tribute to the essential
truthfulness of Captain BAIRNSFATHER'S conception and Mr.
BOURCHIER'S acting that one comes away from <i>The Better 'Ole</i>
feeling that there must be thousands of <i>Old Bills</i> at the
Front fighting for our freedom.</p>
<p>Admirable work is done, too, by Mr. TOM WOOTTWELL as
<i>Bert</i>, the incorrigible amorist, for whom each new girl is
"the only girl," and who has an apparently inexhaustible supply of
identity-discs to leave with them as "sooveneers"; and by Mr.
SINCLAIR COTTER as <i>Alf</i>, the cynical humourist&mdash;"Where
were you eddicated, Eton or Harrod's?" is one of his best
<i>mots</i>&mdash;who spends most of his time in wrestling with an
automatic cigar-lighter. I think it would be only poetical justice
if in the concluding scene, when <i>Old Bill</i> comes into his
own, the authors were for once to allow <i>Alf</i> to succeed in
lighting his "fag."</p>
<p>Of the many ladies who add charm to the entertainment I can only
mention Miss EDM&Eacute;E DORMEUIL, who as <i>Victoire</i> has an
important share in the plot and saves <i>Old Bill's</i> life; Miss
GOODIE REEVE, who sings some capital songs; and Miss PEGGY DORAN,
who looks bewitching as an officer of the Woman Workers' Corps. The
music, arranged by Mr. HERMAN DAREWSKI, is catchy and not
uncomfortably original: and the scenery, designed by Captain
BAIRNSFATHER, gives one, I should say, as good an idea of the
trenches as one can get without going there. In fine I would parody
<i>Old Bill</i> and say, "If you knows of a better show, go to
it!"</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p><i>Monday, August 6th.</i>&mdash;This being Bank Holiday and the
first fine day after a week's downpour, Members for the most part
stayed away from Westminster. Some, it is charitably supposed, have
gone to look after their allotments. Others, it is believed, have
been kept away by a different reason. The taxicab-drivers, men
constitutionally averse from extortion, have refused to enter the
railway-station yards so long as the companies persist in exacting
from them a whole penny for the privilege. Consequently some of our
week-ending legislators are reported to be interned at Waterloo and
Paddington, sitting disconsolately upon their portmanteaux. As an
appeal to the Board of Trade elicited nothing more from Mr. G.
ROBERTS than a disclaimer of personal responsibility, it is
expected that redress will be sought from the Taxi-cabinet.</p>
<p>Mr. HENDERSON'S dual personality continues to arouse curiosity.
There was some justification for Mr. KING'S inquiry whether he went
to Petrograd as a Ministerial <i>Jekyll</i> or a Labourist
<i>Hyde</i>. Mr. BONAR LAW assured the House that on this occasion
at least Mr. HENDERSON went purely as a Cabinet Minister, guiltless
of any duplicity.</p>
<p>Mr. PROTHERO enlivened the discussion on the Corn Production
Bill by a new clause providing that where a farmer failed to
destroy the rabbits on his land the Board of Agriculture should
have power to do it for him and recover the expenses incurred. Sir
JOHN SPEAR expected that in some cases the rabbits secured would
more than defray the cost of the capture, and declared that unless
the farmer was allowed to keep the rabbits the Government would be
guilty of "profiteering." As other agricultural Members appeared to
share this view, Mr. PROTHERO, most obliging of Ministers, agreed
to alter the word "cost" to "net cost." I hope no litigious farmer
will seek to evade his liabilities on the ground that, as the Act
only says "net cost," he need not pay for the ferrets.</p>

<h4>THE FOUNT OF HONOUR AT WORK.</h4>
LORD CURZON CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.
</div>
<p><i>Tuesday, August 7th.</i>&mdash;Those peers who were supposed
to be shaking in their shoes at the thought of Lord SELBORNE'S
impending revelations as to the means by which they acquired their
honours might have spared their tremors. He opened his bag to-day,
but no cat jumped out, not even the smallest kitten. If he had
given a single concrete example of a peer who, having notoriously
no public services at his back, must be presumed to have purchased
his title, he would have created some effect. But the admission
that all his information on the subject was confidential cut the
ground from under his feet; and needless to say none of the Peers
whom he hypothetically accused of buying their coronets responded
to his appeal by standing forth in a white sheet and making open
confession of his crime.</p>
<p>Lord SELBORNE was one of three heirs to peerages who a
generation ago banded themselves together to resist elevation to
the House of Lords. Another of them is Lord CURZON, who answered
him to-night, and whose contempt for the Chamber which he now
adorns seems to have grown with the years that he has spent in it.
Reading between the lines of his speech a cynic could only infer
that the Upper House, as at present constituted, is such a useless
and superfluous assembly that it does not much matter who gets into
it or by what venal ladder he climbs.</p>
<p>The only peers who ventured to get to close quarters with the
scandal were Lord KNUTSFORD, who told a moving tale of how a
potential baronet diverted &pound;25,000 from the London Hospital
to a certain party fund, and thereby achieved his purpose; and Lord
SALISBURY, who declared from his knowledge of Prime Ministers that
they were sick of administering the system of which Lord CURZON was
so ostentatiously ignorant.</p>
<p>Many reasons have been assigned for Mr. CHURCHILL'S reinclusion
in the Ministry, but I am inclined to think that the real one has
only just been discovered. Mr. MACCALLUM SCOTT is one of the most
pertinacious inquisitors of the Treasury Bench; he is also a
whole-souled admirer of the Member for DUNDEE, and has written a
book in eulogy of his achievements by sea and land. Mr. CHURCHILL
has rewarded this devotion by appointing Mr. SCOTT his private
secretary, and, as it is contrary to Parliamentary etiquette for a
Member holding this position to interrogate other Ministers, has
thereby conferred a distinct benefit upon his new colleagues. Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE is now reported to be on the look-out for other
statesmen in whom Mr. HOGGE and Mr. PRINGLE repose a similar trust,

WINSTON'S GIFT TO HIS NEW PRIVATE SECRETARY,<br />
MR. MACCALLUM SCOTT.
</div>
<p><i>Wednesday, August 8th.</i>&mdash;Lord BURNHAM shocked some of
the more ancient peers by his skittish references to the coming
Conference on the Second Chamber. When he expressed the hope that
Lord CURZON would make an explicit statement, on the ground that
their Lordships' House was in no need of a soporific, I fully
expected one of the occupants of the mausoleum to rise and reprove
him in the words of Dr. JOHNSON, "Sir, in order to be facetious it
is not necessary to be indecent."</p>
<p>The advent of the feminine lawyer was rendered a little nearer
when her champions successfully held up a Bill promoted by the
Incorporated Law <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name=
"page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> Society until the Government
undertook to find time for the discussion of a measure enabling
women to become solicitors. Already <i>Shylock</i> is trembling at
the prospect.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, August 9th</i>.&mdash;When the House on two
successive occasions rejected Proportional Representation it was
generally thought that nothing more would be heard of the other
proposals for securing minority representation. To-night, however,
after a brisk debate, the "Alternative vote" in three-cornered
contests was saved in a free division by a single vote; and it was
further decided that "P.R." itself should be adopted at University
elections, despite the unanimous opposition of the University
Representatives.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE CHOICE.</h3>
<p>The bright August sun certainly made the dining-room paper look
dingy. It was a plain, self-coloured paper, but we were rather
attached to it, and didn't like the idea of a change.</p>
<p>But there seemed no help for it, so I arranged to leave my
office early on Friday afternoon, meet Alison at the Marble Arch
tube station and go with her to choose a new paper.</p>
<p>When we reached the wall-paperer's lair we were ushered by an
immaculate personage into a room that looked more like the
dining-room of a private house than a part of business
premises.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," I said, in an awed whisper, "you don't care to have
anything to do with such trifling things
as&mdash;er&mdash;wall-paper?"</p>
<p>"Indeed we do," said the nobleman. "Most important things,
wall-papers. Where did you want it for?"</p>
<p>"For a room in my house, of course," I said. "Not for the
garden."</p>
<p>"Oh, not for the garden. And what sort of house is yours?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"A very nice house," I said.</p>
<p>"I meant what was the style of the house&mdash;Jacobean,
Georgian?"</p>
<p>"Brixtonian rococo outwardly," I said, "as far as I can judge;
but very snug inside. No doubt you could show us something we
should like which would also satisfy your sense of propriety."</p>
<p>"I think it might be managed," he said, waving his hand towards
two or three giant books of patterns.</p>
<p>"What we want," I said, "is something meaty."</p>
<p>"Ah, for the dining-room," he said.</p>
<p>"Well, it's a courtesy title," I said, "but really in these hard
times we have reduced economy to such a fine art that I thought a
wall-paper with body in it might help matters."</p>
<p>"I think I catch the idea," said the marquis. "Something that
would make you feel more satisfied after dinner than you otherwise
would feel, as it were."</p>
<p>"My dear Sir," I said, "you have hit it exactly. Yours is a
sympathetic nature. How readily you have divined my thoughts! No
doubt you too are suffering."</p>
<p>He sighed almost audibly. "How is the room furnished?" he
said.</p>
<p>"Leading features," I said, "a Welsh dresser, rush-bottomed
chairs, gate-legged table, bookcases&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Saxe-blue carpet," said Alison.</p>
<p>"A most important detail," Lord Bayswater said. "Don't you think
something of a chintzy nature would ... etc."</p>
<p>Both Alison and I agreed that a prescription of that kind might
possibly ... etc.</p>
<p>I don't know what is comprised under the term chintzy, but it
appeared to be a comprehensive one, for the nobleman descanted on
the merits of the following patterns among others:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Cockatoos on trees, cockatooing.</p>
<p>(2) Pheasants on trees, eating blackberries.</p>
<p>(3) Other birds on trees, doing nothing in particular.</p>
<p>(4) Roses, in full bloom, half bloom, fading, falling.</p>
<p>(5) Forget-me-nots in bunches, ready for sale.</p>
<p>(6) Grapes doing whatever it is that grapes do.</p>
<p>(7) Other flowers and fruits, also acting after the manner of
their kind.</p>
<p>Many other patterns were shown us and we spent an hour or two
looking at them. Our host tried hard to push the cockatoos on to
us. His idea was that the pattern would act as wallpaper and
pictures combined. Alison's idea was that there would be too many
portraits of cockatoos round the room, and I maintained that the
wretched birds looked so realistic that I should certainly feel I
ought to be giving them some food, and this would of course hardly
assist my idea. The noes had it.</p>
<p>In the end we came away with four patterns (fruits and flowers)
and a promise to let Lord Bayswater know which one we preferred.
One of them I chose really to show my tailor, as it was a top-hole
scheme for a winter waistcoat.</p>
<p>Alison and I spent the evening hanging the patterns up one after
the other on one wall of the dining-room, and tried to paper the
rest of the walls in the mind's eye, but at eleven o'clock we
knocked off for the night and went to bed with headaches.</p>
<p>I fancy Alison must have had a disturbed night. As I was leaving
the house after breakfast she said, "Have you made up your mind
about those patterns?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't," I said. "I'm going to leave it to you. Choose
which you like."</p>
<p>"I've chosen," she said with an air of finality.</p>
<p>"Well," said Alison, when I reached home that evening, "it's
up."</p>
<p>"Up?" I said. "The new paper, already?"</p>
<p>"Come and see," Alison said.</p>
<p>"By Jove, how well it looks!" I said. "You've chosen well.
There's something familiar about it, though it looks almost
new."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Alison, "Ellen and I cleaned it all over with
bread-crumbs."</p>
<p>"Poor Lord Bayswater," I said. "But you've done the right thing.
Wall-paper as usual during the War."</p>

<h3>"SKILLY."</h3>
<p>Prior to "Skilly" being taken on the regimental strength, our
canteen was the paradise of a battalion of mice, from whose nightly
raids nothing was sacred. But from the day "Skilly" enlisted the
marauders became less and less obtrusive. And "Skilly" grew
sleek.</p>
<p>Then came a time of scarcity. Mice fought shy of the canteen,
and "Skilly" visibly suffered from lack of nourishment. A
sergeant's wife provided welcome hospitality; but no sooner was
"Skilly" billeted outside the canteen than the plague returned, and
so she was recalled urgently to active service. Again was the enemy
routed; but again came the wilting-time of dire want. Virtue,
however, did not go unrewarded a second time. "Skilly" had earned
honourable mention, and representations to the proper quarters
resulted in an order that she should be rationed so long as she
remained on canteen duty.</p>
<p>With times of ease came time for love. In due course "Skilly"
presented an absentee and unidentifiable spouse with five bouncing
baby kittens. Throughout their extreme infancy the family throve;
but the time came when the devoted mother was no longer able to
supply sufficient nutriment for five lusty youngsters. Clearly
something must be done, and the canteen sergeant was the man to do
it. He sent in a proper formal application to the regimental
powers, requesting that increased feline rations be ordered as
"subsistence for Canteen Skilly and family of five."</p>
<p>Time passed, and&mdash;let this be read and remembered by all
carping critics who accuse our army of want of method and business
sense&mdash;in due course the application was returned, properly
entered, checked, signed and counter-signed. The verdict run thus:
"Application on behalf of Canteen Skilly refused, as apparently she
married off the strength of the regiment."</p>

<h3>THE REVIEWS FOR &mdash;&mdash;.</h3>
<p><i>(A specimen article for the use of those editors who have
come to the realisation that the contents of our heavier
periodicals never change. All that is needed is the insertion of
the right month and the survey can be used as a serial.)</i></p>
<p>In <i>The Umteenth Century and Forever</i>, which is, as usual,
alert and interesting, the place of honour is given to an article
by Sir Vincent Stodge, M.P., on "Proportional Representation in New
Patagonia." Sir Vincent's argument may or may not convince, but it
is succinctly stated. Sir ERNEST CASSEL writes usefully on "Economy
for Cottagers," and Lord Sopwith, in a paper on "Air Raids and
Glowworms," shows how important it is that on dark nights there
should be some compulsory extinction of the light of these
dangerous and, he fears, pro-German, insects. Mr. HARRY DE WINDT
describes "Galicia as I Knew It," and there are suggestive papers
on "The Probable Course of History for the next Three Centuries,"
by the Dean of LINCOLN; "Potatoes as Food," by Sir WALTER RALEIGH;
and "Hair in Relation to Eminence," by Dr. SALEEBY, in which all
the strong men in history famous for their locks, from SAMSON to
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, are passed in review. An excellent number, full
of mental nutriment, is brought to a close by a symposium of
Bishops on the petrol restrictions.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>By a strange coincidence <i>The Shortsightly</i> also has a
valuable paper on "Proportional Representation," by Mr. and Mrs.
C.N. WILLIAMSON, who thus make their bow for the first time among
what might be called our thinking novelists, their effort being in
some degree balanced by an essay in the same number from so
inveterate a politician as Mr. J.M. HOGGE, M.P., on the "Wit and
Humour of WILLIAM LE QUEUX." There is also an anonymous article of
great power on "Conscientious Objectors as Food for Racehorses,"
which should cause discussion, both by reason of its arguments and
also through the secret of its authorship, which to the initiated
is only of course a <i>secret de Polichinelle</i>. For the rest we
content ourselves with drawing attention to "The Small Holding," by
Lord PIRRIE; "Women and Tobacco," by the Manager of the Piccadilly
Hotel; "Feud Control," by Mr. PHILIP SNOWDEN, M.P.; "Russia as I
knew it," by Mr. HARRY DE WINDT; and "The Spirit of Ireland," by
Sir JOHN POWER.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>The Peremptory Review</i> opens with Lord CURZON'S
well-reasoned appeal to Labour to relinquish its attitude of
criticism and trust the powers that be. Other notable articles deal
with the possible effect of woman's franchise on the cult of
Pekinese spaniels, the case pro and con. for a tunnel under St.
George's Channel, and the philosophy of E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM. Mr.
HARRY DE WINDT writes of "Serbia as I Knew It." A spirited attack
on the MINISTER of MUNITIONS by the Editor of <i>The Morning
Post</i> brings an excellent number to a close.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Backwood's</i> is, as usual, strong in the martial element,
and is further proof that in the present conflict there is no
excluding rivalry between pen and sword, but plenty of room for
both. The article wittily entitled, "Mess-up-otamia" should be read
by everyone who is not tired of that theme. The trenchant author of
"Reflections without Rancour" displays his customary vigilance as a
censor of <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>, not sparing the whip even when
some of the animals are dead.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In the ever iconoclastic and live <i>Gnashing All Review</i> Mr.
Smacksy is, as usual, at his most vigorous. Among the statesmen who
come in for his attacks are Mr. ASQUITH and Lord HALDANE, both of
whom are probably by now quite inured to his blows. Nothing could
be more amusing than the renewed play which is made with the
phrase, "spiritual home." Mr. Smacksy has also something to say to
members of what might be called his own Party. Other articles deal
with "The Psychology of the Pacifist," a trenchant exposure; "The
Teeth of American Presidents," which contains a number of curious
statistics; "The Film and the Future," by Viscount CHAPLIN; "The
Honours List," in which the anonymous writer makes the
revolutionary suggestion that the KING'S birthday should in future
be marked by the withdrawal of old titles instead of the conferring
of new. Mr. HARRY DE WINDT descries "Roumania as I Knew It"; "A
Suggestion for the Settlement of the Irish Problem" is offered by
Mr. GINNELL, M.P.; and Mr. C.B. COCHRAN utters a disinterested plea
for "The Small Theatre."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>The Jinglish Review</i>, also famous for the activity of its
fighting editor, has no fewer than four articles from his pen, of
which the least negligible is perhaps that of "The Partition of
Europe after the War." The others deal with "The Real Germany,"
"Sunday Journalism as a World Asset," and "HORATIO BOTTOMLEY the
Prophet." Other contributions in a varied number include a series
of votive verses to Mr. EDWARD MARSH, C.B., by a band of Georgian
poets, on the occasion of his resumption of his duties as private
secretary to Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL. A charming study of leprosy,
translated from the Russian of Lugubriski, brings the number to a
close.</p>

<h2>DUELLING EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>
<p>The contemplated single-stick encounter between Colonel
ARCHER-SHEE and Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING recalls to mind a ludicrous
affair which actually happened some years ago in a foreign city
which I will here call Killemalivo.</p>
<p>Mr. Alec McTavish, a Briton many years resident in that fair
capital and editor of the only English newspaper, had taken up
stout verbal cudgels on behalf of the Americans, who had been
viciously attacked in the columns of a local "daily." The United
States of the North, in its capacity of "special" to the entire
American continent, comes in for plenty of abuse when a new
revolution is about to be perpetrated.</p>
<p>The strife had waxed fast and furious and eventually had taken
on a personal tone, the editor of <i>La Muera</i> accusing the
editor of the English paper of being "that lowest of all living
things&mdash;a Texan." It will be remembered that in times gone by
the State of Texas decided to desert its Latin parents and roost
under the shadow of the eagle's wing, thereby earning for itself
prosperity and an evil reputation&mdash;in certain quarters.</p>
<p>McTavish's editorial reply was a gem of satire and displayed an
intimate knowledge of the antecedents of the rival editor.</p>
<p>At that time duelling was still prevalent, and it was not many
days before the editorial sanctum of <i>The Tribune</i> was
honoured by the visit of two officers in full-dress uniform.</p>
<p>The eventual outcome of their visit was that Mr. McTavish found
himself pledged to fight a duel with a man who was, among other
things, a first-class pistol shot and exceptionally expert with the
"florette," all of which McTavish was not.</p>
<p>The affair looked particularly unpleasant&mdash;to McTavish, who
was short, fat, and by no means young. But the dignity of the
foreign population as represented by the editor of <i>The
Killemalivo Tribune</i> must of necessity be upheld.</p>
<p>Faced by this quite unusual difficulty, McTavish bethought him
of his old and tried friend, General O'Flynnone, an Irish-American
of many years' residence in the Latin Americas. No one seemed to
know his real name, and the title of General had come to him from
his last place.</p>
<p>The General was delighted at the turn of events, agreed to be
McTavish's second, and promised to get him through the affair with
a whole skin and no loss of honour.</p>
<p>As the challenged party McTavish had choice of weapons, which
was the crux of the situation, as the General pointed out.</p>
<p>Among the Killemalivo aristocracy the favourite weapons were the
duelling pistol and the "florette," or rapier. The "pelado," or
lower orders, preferred the "lingua de vaca," which means literally
"cow's tongue," a nasty-looking knife of no mean proportions.</p>
<p>As O'Flynnone explained, the duel would have to be fought with
"killing weapons"; nothing else would satisfy the bloodthirsty
editor. Meanwhile he would think on the matter, and he advised
McTavish to do likewise.</p>
<p>The following were the most unpleasant days of his life, as
McTavish confessed afterwards. He was not a "conscientious
objector," but he had no pressing wish to exterminate his opponent,
as that would have necessitated a sudden and forcible exile from
the land of his adoption; still less did he fancy an early demise
in the interests of his paper.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the General visited the rival editor's seconds and
arranged for a meeting in his own rooms to discuss final
conditions.</p>
<p>O'Flynnone's rooms contained, among other things, a collection
of curious and ancient weapons. The walls were decorated with all
sorts and conditions of strange and barbarous instruments of
slaughter; Zulu assegais, Afghan knives and Burmese swords hung in
savage array.</p>
<p>The meeting took place on the following Sunday afternoon. The
officers greeted the General agreeably enough, but saluted McTavish
with the stiffness that the occasion called for.</p>
<p>"Well, Se&ntilde;ores," commenced the General, after depositing
his visitors in the most comfortable chairs, "to business. Mr.
McTavish, as you will admit, has the choice of weapons."</p>
<p>The officers nodded assent.</p>
<p>"This gentleman," continued O'Flynnone, "comes of that most
noble and warlike race&mdash;the Scotch. Fiercest of fighters,
although they do not sometimes look it, the warriors of Scotland
alone among all nations withstood the ravages of the conquering
English. I feel sorry, very sorry for the 'caballero' whom you have
the honour to represent."</p>
<p>The pause which followed was most impressive. The General's air
was suggestive of dire things, as with dramatic suddenness he
produced from beneath the sideboard two enormous double-edged
battle-axes, which careful polishing had made to shine as new.</p>
<p>"These," said he, "are the weapons which Mr. McTavish has
chosen&mdash;weapons of men, such as they use in his own country,"
he continued, brandishing one of them savagely. "And the fight will
be on barebacked horses, for such is the custom of the Scotch."</p>
<p>The duel did not occur.</p>
<hr />
<h2>THE GAME OF HIS LIFE.</h2>
<p>I met the mercurial Gosling at the club a few days ago. As I
hadn't seen him for some time I asked if he had been on a holiday.
"Yes," he said, "down at Shinglestrand. Golfing? No&mdash;yes. I
did play one game, the first since the War, and rather a remarkable
game it was. I'm a member of the golf-club there, and was down at
the clubhouse one morning looking at the papers when a fat
middle-aged man, about my age, asked me if I cared for a game. I
didn't, but in a spirit of self-sacrifice said that I should be
very glad. 'I think I ought to tell you,' he went on, 'that I don't
care about playing with a 18-handicap man, and that I always like
to have a sovereign on the match.' Now I never was much of a
player&mdash;too erratic, I suppose. My handicap has gone up from
12 to 18, and the last time I played it was about 24. But,
exasperated by his swank, I suddenly found myself saying, 'My
handicap is 12.' 'Very well,' replied the fat man, 'I'll give you 4
strokes.' We went out to the first tee, and after he had made a
moderate shot I hit the drive of my life. My second landed on the
green and I ran down a long putt&mdash;this for a 4-bogey hole. I'm
not going to bore you with details. I won the second and third
holes, and then the fat man went to pieces. I never wanted any of
my strokes and downed him by 5 and 3. As we re-entered the
club-house my partner, who had become strangely silent, walked up
to the board which gives the list of handicaps and looked at them.
There was my name with 18 opposite it. 'I thought you said your
handicap was 12,' he observed. 'Well,' I answered, 'it wasn't more
than that this morning.' The fat man was very angry. He said he
would report me to the committee, and he did. But the secretary
(who happens to be my brother) played up nobly. He communicated
with the secretary of the fat man's club, whom he happened to know,
and, having found out that the fat man's handicap was not 6 but 12,
he wrote to him to say that in view of the fact that 'the lies had
been equally bad on both sides' the committee did not propose to
take any action. The fat man got no change out of my brother and I
kept my sovereign."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>
<p>In <i>No Man's Land</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is revealed a
breadth of vision which may astonish some of us who have been
inclined to regard SAPPER as merely a talented story-teller. Among
the writers on the War I place him first, for the simple reason
that I like him best; and I am not at all sure that I should like
him any better if he cured himself of his cardinal fault. With his
tongue in his cheek he dashes away from his story to give us either
a long or short digression; no more confirmed digressionist ever
put pen to paper, and the wonderful thing is that these wanton
excursions are worth following. True he often apologises for them,
but I do not think that we need take these apologies seriously.
This book is divided into four parts, "The Way to the Land," "The
Land," "Seed Time," and "Harvest," and in "Seed Time," at any rate,
we have a series of chapters which require not only to be read but
to be thought over. But whether he is out for fun, as in "Bendigo
Jones&mdash;His <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name=
"page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> Tree," or for pathos, as in
"Morphia," he obtains his effects without the smallest appearance
of effort. And I reserve a special word of praise for "My Lady of
the Jasmine," and commend it to the notice of those pessimists who
hold that only the French and the Americans can write a good short
story. Thank the powers that be for SAPPER.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>The Loom of Youth</i> (GRANT RICHARDS) is yet another school
story, but with a difference, the difference being, partly at
least, that it is written by one who has so lately ceased to belong
himself to the life described that his account must carry an
authority altogether unusual. Here, one feels, is that strange and
so-soon-forgotten country revealed for us from within, and by a
native denizen. For this alone Mr. ALEC WAUGH'S book merits the
epithet remarkable; indeed, considered as the work of "a lad of
seventeen," its vitality, discretion and general maturity of tone
seem little short of amazing. Realism is the note of it. The modern
schoolboy, as Mr. WAUGH paints him, employs, for example, a
vocabulary whose frequency, and freedom may possibly startle the
parental reader. Apart from this one might call the book an
indictment of hero-worship, as heroism is understood in a society
where (still!) athletic eminence places its possessor above all
laws. This in itself is so old an educational problem that it is
interesting to find it handled afresh in a study of ultra-modern
boyhood. The actual matter of the tale, individual character in its
reaction to system, is naturally common to most school stories; but
even here Mr. WAUGH has contrived to give an ending both original
and sincere. Prophecy is dangerous; but from a writer who has
proved so brilliantly that, for once, <i>jeunesse peut</i>, one
seems justified in hoping that enlarged experience will result in
work of the highest quality.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quite a host of moral reflections, none of them very original,
flock to one's mind in considering by what devious ways our Italian
allies came to range themselves on the side of that freedom which
they have always loved as well and bravely as any of the rest of
us. For instance&mdash;a very stale reflection&mdash;one sees
Germany overdoing her own cleverness and under-rating that of her
neighbours&mdash;this more especially in her arrogant dominance of
Italy's commerce; further, one notices the Hun's Belgian
brutalities costing him dear in a quarter least expected; and again
one realises Italy's decision as a thing mainly dependent, in spite
of all Germany's taking little ways, on a righteous hatred of
Austria&mdash;a consideration which brings one surprisingly near to
gratitude towards the big-bully Government of Vienna. Our southern
ally's loyalty to her beautiful "unredeemed" provinces, and her
claim, which all right-minded Englishmen (I include myself) most
heartily endorse, to dominate the historically Italian waters of
the Adriatic, happily proved too strong for a machine-made sympathy
for Berlin based on nothing better than a superficial resemblance
between the histories of Piedmont and Prussia, and a record of
nominal alliance with powers whose respect for paper treaties was
always fairly apparent. All the same, in reading Mr. W. KAY
WALLACE'S essay in recent history, <i>Greater Italy</i>
(CONSTABLE), a volume which I cannot too strongly commend for its
admirable way of telling these and similar things, I am struck most
of all by the super-incumbent mass of Germanism that had to be
burst asunder before the true Italy broke free. The story of that
liberation is romance of an amazing order, for in it one sees the
very soul of a great and ancient people struggling to renewal of
life. It is more than good to have such an ally, it is an
inspiration.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you wish to complete your knowledge of the working of our new
armies and learn something of the business of the A.S.C. you can do
so without being bored in <i>L. of C.</i> (CONSTABLE), by Captain
JAMES AGATE. The author is one of that bright band of Mancunians
which <i>The Manchester Guardian</i> has attached to its august
fringes. He writes of the business in hand, the vagaries of stores
and indents and mere men and brass hats, on this and the other side
of the Channel, all with a very light and engaging pen, and then
spreads himself on any old far-off thing that interests him, such
as the theatre, perhaps a little self-consciously and with a
pleasant air of swagger most forgivable and, indeed, enjoyable. His
chief preoccupation is with art and letters, it is clear; but,
turning from them to the handling of urgent things and difficult
men, he faces the business manfully. Of the men in particular he
has illuminating things to say, redounding to their credit and, by
implication, to his. To those who appreciate form in penwork this
book may be safely recommended.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
